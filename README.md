## Admin Attendance View

Experimental plugin for WordPress. Expects and builds on:

* [Event Tickets](https://github.com/moderntribe/event-tickets)
* [The Events Calendar](https://github.com/moderntribe/the-events-calendar) _*not strictly required_

Adds a list-like view of ticket sales/attendance across all events (builds on Event Tickets and/or The Events Calendar)
to the admin environment, making it easy to review sales and remaining capacity at a glance.

#### Notes

* Built for use with Event Tickets 4.2.7
* May or may not work with other versions
* Unsupported
